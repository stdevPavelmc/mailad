#   - Install dependencies of the provision process, depending on what OS and flavour you are in
#
# Notice: You need to provide a line like this after a success
#    echo "done" > deps
#
# And not doing that after failure, that way it will not install on a unknown distro

# import he common file with the list of default pkgs
source ./common.conf || source common.conf
