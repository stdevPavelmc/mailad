# Translations

This document contains the guidelines for MailAD Translations

## Goal

The mail goal is to stablish the guidelines for contributions with translations to other langguages other than english; this will help you as to avoid no duplicate work and time lost.

At the begining the focus will be the documentation. 

## Guidelines

This are the main ones, it can change with time:

0. The translations must be done in a new file from the original adding the [two letter language code](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) to the name, so for spanish `README.md` will be `README.es.md` the new files must be palced under the `i18n` directory.
0. You must start with the original file and only translate the explanatory text, don't translate the texts inside a code block as it's a software generated one, that must remain in the original language.
0. All documentations translations PR must be made against the `development` branch, I will be responsible for revision and merging.
0. Please just make a PR when you have a translation of a document in full, avoid to send partial translations, this will waste your time and mine.
0. You can claim the authorship of a translation, you can insert a hidden line like the one on top of this document with your data, I will respect them when you send it _(this line will not be shown via web but yes locally)_
0. When you intend to start a translation please go to [issue #10](https://github.com/stdevPavelmc/mailad/issues/10) and check if no other person is working on that document and language.
