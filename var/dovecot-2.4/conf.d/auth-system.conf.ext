# authentication to actually work. <https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/core/config/auth/databases/pam.html>

  # fields {
  #   uid = 500
  #   gid = 500
  #   home = /var/mail/%{user}
  # }
  # LDA and LMTP needs to look up users only from the userdb. This of course
  # doesn't work with static userdb because there is no list of users.
  # Normally static userdb handles this by doing a passdb lookup. This works
  # with most passdbs, with PAM being the most notable exception. If you do
  # the user verification another way, you can add allow_all_users=yes
  # in which case the passdb lookup is skipped.
